Spark Interview Questions:

What is apache Spark
What are the distributed collections? 
What is an RDD
What is DF and DS
Difference between DF and DS
---------------
Actions and Transformations
Untyped vs Typed Transformations ( what distributed collections untyped transformatons return and  typed transformations return)
-----------------
How to run spark programs?

What is Spark-sumbit utility

WHen a spark job starts?  (Action)
What is a stage and Task ? (wide transformaton , narrow transformation)

when Exectors starts ? 

Actions will send data to Driver -> 
how to identify a method is action or transformation? -> Actions returns non distributed collections
Transformations returns distributed collections.
-----------------
What is client mode and cluster mode

Spark application flow when submit jobs to YARN ->

Developer -> driver memory,cpu cores , exector mem,cpu for each exe, number of exec 
----------------------
Data Source :::
Files  - unstructed , structed ->
unstructed files -> log files, text data - these are human readable - (non humanreadable - Sequence file , Avro ) ( what is avro,avro serialization ) 
Structured files -> csv,json, xml , (pure structured data sources - ORC, Parquet)

RDBMS -> JDBC connectivity 

Streams -> Kafka , Network ports , logfiles in real time 

Read data from BigData sources (HDFS, HBASE, Cassandra , Hive Tables) using low level code(DF code , RDD code)  vs SQL 

How to read text files using SCALA (not via Spark Libraries)

----------------------------


WHere you can hold this data  in Spark ??? Data Structures  (to hold unstructured and structured sources)
inmemory Data structures - distributed collections 
list array vs distributed data structures.

What is an RDD -> 
collection of objects (the objects can be string,int, or custom objects) 
unlike non distributed collections list and map or set, which can be present in only one machine java heap memory, RDDs can be divided , stored and processed using multiple machines java heap space.

------------------------------------
How to choose partitions and no of execturos and memory for each exector, no of cpu cores for each exector
CPU cores and Memory for Driver program- How to determine??
------------------------------------

RDD properties :::
cache vs persist , Checkpoint  and how to set check point dir
what are persist levels 
----------------------------------------
When to go for python based spark programming vs Scala based Spark ??? 
WHich is better ?
When to choose hadoop ecosystem and Spark Eco system 
(from Architectural point - what you choose? combination or individual eco system -
if you choose combination what is the cost??? 
--------------------------------------
RDDs
what is lineage graph and how to see ? toDebugString

How to see explain plan for SQL and DataFrame DSL? will there be any difference??

-------------------------------------------

Syntax for Spark-submit utility
Spark Configuration in Source code vs Command line 
Write Spark (scala or Java ) full fledged application

How to choose various cluster managers while running spark applications.


----------------------
Cost of Transformations ? 
Actions vs Transforamtions - Job stage task


Explain word count Spark application witten in scala.
what is Map transformation , what it does??
FlatMap ?? 
WHich is better (group by key or Reduce by key)
what is pair RDD and PairRDD functions ?? 
----------------------------------
What is shuffle and Sort
Combiner 
Partitioner and Hash Partitioner

When partitioner will be used??? 
------------------------------------

Integrate Spark with Hadoop 
Integrate Spark with hive metastore
Integrate Spark with Kafka and RDBMS
------------------------------------

Spark Streaming ( Spark 1.x vs Spark 2.x ) 
Write basic programs in SCALA and JAVA.
----------------------------------------
Scala Language::::
obejct
class
companion objects
trait
aiuxillary construcotrs
functions and functional programming
partially applied functions
Closures

Tail Recursion
Inheritance

File Reading using Scala .

Programming Scala Book
